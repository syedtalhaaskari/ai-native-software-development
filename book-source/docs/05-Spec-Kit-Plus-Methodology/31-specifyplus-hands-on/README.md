# Chapter 31: Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On

Welcome to hands-on specification-driven development. This chapter transforms understanding (from Chapter 30) into practice. You won't read about specifications—you'll write them. You won't learn about AI collaboration—you'll build projects with your AI companion from specifications to implementation.


Whether you're eager to start coding or skeptical that specs are worth the time, this chapter proves the value through direct experience: building projects specification-first is faster, more reliable, and more scalable than code-first development.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this chapter, you'll understand:

3. How SpecifyPlus systematizes specification thinking
4. Why Spec→Plan→Tasks→Code cascade works empirically
5. How to use `/sp.specify` within Claude Code for gap identification
6. How to use `/sp.plan` within Claude Code for planning
7. How to use `/sp.tasks` within Claude Code for decomposition
8. How to use `/sp.implement` within Claude Code for code generation
9. How to validate AI-generated code using 6-phase protocol
10. That specifications are the primary artifact (not code)
11. That validation is a non-negotiable professional skill
12. How humans and AI collaborate in specification-driven development
13. Complete confidence to tackle Chapter 32's advanced capstone project

Most importantly, you'll build the muscle memory for specification-first thinking that makes you dramatically faster in Chapters 32 and beyond.
