## Directory Structure Reference

**For complete directory structure specification**: See **`specs/book/directory-structure.md`**

This document provides chapter titles and topics. For exact file paths, naming conventions, and folder organization, consult `directory-structure.md`.

**Quick Reference**:
- Chapters are **directories** (not files): `book-source/docs/NN-Part-Name/NN-chapter-name/`
- Each chapter contains lesson files: `01-lesson-1.md`, `02-lesson-2.md`, etc.
- Chapter folders use **lowercase-with-hyphens**
- Part folders use **Title-Case-With-Hyphens**

**Examples** (based on actual structure):
- Chapter 1: `book-source/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-ai-development-revolution/`
- Chapter 5: `book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/05-claude-code-features-and-workflows/`
