## Directory Structure Reference

**For complete directory structure specification**: See **`specs/book/directory-structure.md`**

This document provides chapter titles and topics. For exact file paths, naming conventions, and folder organization, consult `directory-structure.md`.

**Quick Reference**:
- Chapters are **directories** (not files): `book-source/docs/NN-Part-Name/NN-chapter-name/`
- Each chapter contains lesson files: `01-lesson-1.md`, `02-lesson-2.md`, etc.
- Chapter folders use **lowercase-with-hyphens**
- Part folders use **Title-Case-With-Hyphens**

**Examples** (based on actual structure):
- Chapter 1: `book-source/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-ai-development-revolution/`
- Chapter 5: `book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/05-claude-code-features-and-workflows/`

## Using This Index

**When creating a chapter**:
1. Find the chapter number and title in this index
2. Use the filename from this index
3. Place file in the correct part folder
4. Set `sidebar_position: [N]` in YAML frontmatter to the chapter number
5. Match the title exactly in frontmatter
6. Reference `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md` for formatting guidelines

**Version**: Updated for Part 2, 3, 5 redesign: 14-part, 57-chapter structure with AI Orchestration chapter. Chapter 8 (Git and GitHub) added to Part 2; Chapters 9-11 renumbered in Part 3; Chapters 12-13 marked as implemented (2025-11-08). **Chapter 13 validation complete (2025-11-08)**: 4 lessons with Python 3.14.0, type hints core, "Try With AI" format standardized, Rules 6&7 integrated, technical-reviewer PASS.
